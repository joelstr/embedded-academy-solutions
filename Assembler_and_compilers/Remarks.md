# Remarks on assembler lab

The second lab gave you an opportunity to test some basic assembly code.

Some key concepts from this lab:

- Using the debugger to step through code and look at registers
- Using the disassembly to look at code before and after your own code block
- Make sure to always give a value to your outputs from the `asm()`-block, otherwise you would get odd behavior
