# Remarks on electronics lab

This weeks lab proved to be a bit more difficult. Biggest struggle seemed to be to set the sequence register properly, it could be a bit confusing with the predefined masks accessing all bits in SQR0.

Enabling the voltage regulator could also be a bit confusing, as well as the lack of calibration which caused an offset. This caused the value when removing voltage to not fall al the way to zero which caused some confusion.
